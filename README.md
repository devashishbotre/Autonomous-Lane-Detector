# Autonomous-Lane-Detector
This project implements an end-to-end Autonomous Lane Detection pipeline using deep learning techniques on the TuSimple dataset. The model architecture is based on a RESA-based (Recurrent Feature Shift Aggregator) design, incorporating a ResNet encoder, RESA module, and custom decoder to accurately detect and predict lane lines
